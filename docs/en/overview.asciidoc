== Overview

eland is an open source, Apache2-licensed {es} Python client to analyse, explore 
and manipulate data that resides in {es}. Where possible the package uses 
existing Python APIs and data structures to make it easy to switch between 
Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn to their {es} powered equivalents. In general, the 
data resides in {es} and not in memory, which allows eland to access large 
datasets stored in {es}.

The eland source code is hosted on GitHub in 
https://github.com/elastic/eland[the eland repository].
